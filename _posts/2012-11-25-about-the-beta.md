A few points about the things I'm working on:

 - Right now you have to remember to click Save, or your changes will be lost. I'm planning to start
   saving as you go along, and remove the explicit Save button.

 - Error reporting isn't pretty - please excuse the occasional alert box.

 - I haven't put much time into testing on mobile devices or Internet Explorer. The site works OK,
   but I've put my effort into the desktop so far.

 - I'm working on adding graphics using the [D3.js](http://d3js.org/) library: the Visualise tab
   currently supports simple line charts, and it tries to guess how to display your data based on
   the F# type.

 - Again, feel free to [tweet me](https://twitter.com/1tgr) (or [email me](mailto:tim@fsnotebook.net))
with any problems, feedback or ideas.
